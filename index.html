  <blockquote>
    <p>Starphleet is a toolkit for turning virtual or physical machine infrastructure into a continuous deployment stack, running multiple Git-backed services on one more nodes via Linux containers. </p>
    <p>Starphleet borrows heavily from the concepts of the Twelve-Factor App, and uses an approach that avoids many of the problems inherent in existing autodeployment solutions: </p>
  </blockquote>

  <ul>
    <li>Conventional virtualization, with multiple operating systems running on shared physical hardware, wastes resources, specifically RAM and CPU. This costs real money.</li>
    <li>Autodeploy PaaS has the same vendor lock-in risks of old proprietary software.</li>
    <li>Continuous deployment is almost always a custom scripting exercise.</li>
    <li>Multiple machine / clustered deployment is extra work.</li>
    <li>Making many small services is more work than making megalith services.</li>
    <li>Deployment systems all seem to be at the system not service level.</li>
    <li>Every available autodeploy system requires that you set up servers to deploy your servers, which themselves aren't autodeployed.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="phleet">Phleet</h2>
  <p>A <a href="#phleet">phleet</a> is a grouping of <a href="#ship">starphleet ships</a>. The entire phleet points to a single <a href="#headquarters">headquarters</a>. These ships may be geographically located for latency or maintained in a single region.
    A phleet is comprised of machines that are intended to be identical for easy scaling.
    <h2 id="ship">Ship</h2>
    <p>
      A ship is an Ubuntu 14.04 EC2 instance running a base install of Ubuntu. The starphleet installation will handle installing all needed software on the server.
    </p>
    <h2 id="headquarters">Headquarters</h2>
    <p>
      The headquarters is a special <a href="https://github.com/wballard/starphleet.headquarters">Git repo</a> that is the <i>brains</i> of your <a href="#phleet">phleet</a>. The Headquarters will store all your environment and configuration options.
      This repo will also contain all your credentials and confidential information. It is important to keep your headquarter security restrictive. An example and template headquarters can be found <a href="https://github.com/wballard/starphleet.headquarters">here</a>.
    </p>
    <h2 id="orders">Orders</h2>
    <p>The orders file is a special file inside a subdirectory off the root directory of the <a href="#headquarters">headquarters</a>. For Example:</p>

    {% highlight bash %}
       ./                  # <== Root of the Git repo used as a Starphleet Headquarters
       ./service1/orders   # <== Maps to http://services.example.com/service1
    {% endhighlight %}

    <p>Each subdirectory off the root of the <a href="#headquarters">headquarters</a> is checked for an <a href="#orders">orders file</a>. Starphleet will look inside the <a href="#orders">orders file</a> for deploy commands and environment variables for the service. There is a 1-1 mapping between the subdirectory that contains an <a href="#orders">orders file</a> and the url of the service deployed.</p>
