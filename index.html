  <h1 id="overview" class="page-header">Overview</h1>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Starphleet is a toolkit for turning virtual or physical machine infrastructure into a continuous deployment stack, running multiple Git-backed services on one more nodes via Linux containers. </p>
    <p>Starphleet borrows heavily from the concepts of the Twelve-Factor App, and uses an approach that avoids many of the problems inherent in existing autodeployment solutions: </p>
  </blockquote>

  <ul>
    <li>Conventional virtualization, with multiple operating systems running on shared physical hardware, wastes resources, specifically RAM and CPU. This costs real money.</li>
    <li>Autodeploy PaaS has the same vendor lock-in risks of old proprietary software.</li>
    <li>Continuous deployment is almost always a custom scripting exercise.</li>
    <li>Multiple machine / clustered deployment is extra work.</li>
    <li>Making many small services is more work than making megalith services.</li>
    <li>Deployment systems all seem to be at the system not service level.</li>
    <li>Every available autodeploy system requires that you set up servers to deploy your servers, which themselves aren't autodeployed.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="features">Features</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Linux CGROUP and container isolation</li>
    <li>Continuous Deployment</li>
    <li>Centralized Configuration</li>
    <li>Easily combine many micro-services into a large application</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="phleet">Phleet</h3>
  <p>A <a href="#phleet">phleet</a> is a grouping of <a href="#ship">starphleet ships</a>. The entire phleet points to a single <a href="#headquartersrepo">headquarters</a>. These ships may be geographically located for latency or maintained in a single region.
    A phleet is comprised of machines that are intended to be identical for easy scaling.
    <h3 id="ship">Ship</h3>
    <p>
      A ship is an Ubuntu 14.04 EC2 instance running a base install of Ubuntu. The starphleet installation will handle installing all needed software on the server.
    </p>
    <h3 id="headquartersrepo">Headquarters</h3>
    <p>
      The headquarters is a special <a href="https://github.com/wballard/starphleet.headquarters">Git repo</a> that is the <i>brains</i> of your <a href="#phleet">phleet</a>. The Headquarters will store all your environment and configuration options.
      This repo will also contain all your credentials and confidential information. It is important to keep your headquarter security restrictive. An example and template headquarters can be found <a href="https://github.com/wballard/starphleet.headquarters">here</a>.
    </p>
    <h3 id="orders">Orders</h3>
    <p>The orders file is a special file inside a subdirectory off the root directory of the <a href="#headquartersrepo">headquarters</a>. For Example:</p>

    {% highlight bash %}
   ./                  # <== Root of the Git repo used as a Starphleet Headquarters
   ./service1/orders   # <== Maps to http://services.example.com/service1 {% endhighlight %}

    <p>Each subdirectory off the root of the <a href="#headquartersrepo">headquarters</a> is checked for an <a href="#orders">orders file</a>. Starphleet will look inside the <a href="#orders">orders file</a> for deploy commands and environment variables for the service. There is a 1-1 mapping between the subdirectory that contains an <a href="#orders">orders file</a> and the url of the service deployed.</p>
    <h3 id="service">Service</h3>
    <p>Service STuff!</p>
    <h3 id="environmentvariables">Environment Variables</h3>

  <h1 id="headquarters" class="page-header">Headquarters</h1>
  <p>
    The <a href="#headquartersrepo">Starphleet Headquarters</a> is a Git repo with all the master configurations for the entire phleet of servers.  It will contain the deploy commands for every service, keys for ssh console access to the ships, ssl certificates for the domain(s) you assign to the ship, configuration settings for authentication for each service as well as how the machine can reach LDAP servers, and any other major configuration item.
  </p>
  <p>
    Aside from special directories, each directory in the headquarters is assumed to be a <a href="#remote">remote</a> or <a href="#service">service</a>
  </p>
  <h3 id="specialfiles">Special Files</h3>
  <p>Starphleet makes use of a centralized configuration stored in a separate Git repo. This repo should be secure and restricted.  The Headquarters repo contains the configuration for every service and ship in a phleet.  This repo will have special directories and files outlined below:</p>

  <h3 id="servicefiles">Service Files</h3>
  <p>To create a service endpoint you create a new directory off the root of the headquarters.  Inside the directory you create an orders file which contains configuration options and deploy commands for the service.  This file will tell Starphleet which Git repo to deploy at this endpoint.  The following is what the directory structure will look like along with a few of the files that might be associated with your service:</p>

<section class="bs-docs-section">
  <h1 id="usage" class="page-header">Usage</h1>

  <h2 id="pages">Pages</h2>
  <p>The main page is the <code>index.html</code> file. You can also add additional pages by creating <code>.html</code> files in the root folder or in any sub-folder. Each page file must begins with a template declaration:</p>

  {% highlight html %} --- layout: default title: Home description: Simple documentation template for Github pages ---

  <!-- content -->
  {% endhighlight %}

  <p>Set <code>isHome</code> to <code>true</code> on the main page file, the homepage will have a bigger header with a central download button.</p>

  {% highlight html %} --- .......... isHome: true --- {% endhighlight %}

  <p>Set <code>hide</code> to <code>true</code> to hide a page from the main menu, the page will still be accessible with direct link. <a href="hidden.html">Example</a>.</p>

  {% highlight html %} --- .......... hide: true --- {% endhighlight %}

  <h2 id="titles">Titles</h2>
  <p>In order to get the right menu automatically generated you must respect some conventions.</p>

  {% highlight html %}
  <!-- wrap each main section with "bs-docs-section" class -->
  <section class="bs-docs-section">
    <!-- each section must contain ONE h1 with an id and optionally a "page-header" class -->
    <h1 id="first-level" class="page-header">First level</h1>

    <!-- you can optionally declare sub-sections with h2/h3 with an id -->
    <h2 id="sub-section">Second level</h2>

    <h3 id="another-sub-section">Still second level</h3>
  </section>
  {% endhighlight %}

  <h2 id="highlight">Syntax highlight</h2>
  <p>The powerful Pygments highlighter is activated on the template, just wrap your unescaped source code with the <code>{{ "{% highlight ... " }}%}</code> directive.</p>

  {% highlight text %} {{ "{% highlight html " }}%}
  <div>Some <b>HTML</b></div>
  {{ "{% endhighlight " }}%} {{ "{% highlight javascript " }}%} alert('Some javascript'); {{ "{% endhighlight " }}%} {% endhighlight %}

  <h2 id="resources">Resources &amp; links</h2>
  <p>If you need to create internal links between your pages, or include resources (JS &amp; CSS), always start your URLs with <code>{{ "{{site.github.url" }}}}</code>.</p>

  {% highlight html %}
  <script src="{{ " {{site.github.url " }}}}/dist/my-script.js"></script>

  <a href="{{ " {{site.github.url " }}}}/about/index.html">About</a> {% endhighlight %}

  <h2 id="bootbox">Bootbox</h2>
  <p><a href="http://bootboxjs.com/">Bootbox</a> is installed with a syntax sugar to easily create pop-in content. To use this sugar you must create a clickable element with a <code>data-bootbox</code> attribute and an hidden content holder with a corresponding
    <code>id</code> attribute.</p>

  {% highlight html %}
  <button class="btn btn-primary btn-xs" data-bootbox="my-content">Button title</button>

  <div id="my-content" class="hidden" title="Pop-in title">
    Pop-in content
  </div>
  {% endhighlight %}

  <h2 id="gems">Plugins</h2>
  <p>All available Jekyll plugins are installed by default, you can remove them by modifying the <code>gems</code> parameter in <code>_config.yml</code>. See the documentation on <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-plugins-with-github-pages/">GitHub Help</a>    pages.</p>

  <h2 id="bower">Bower</h2>
  <p>Fell free to use the <code>bower.json</code> to manage your front dependencies. Bower packages are added the <code>dist</code> directory and <b>MUST</b> be pushed to the repository. jQuery and Bootstrap are ignored by <code>.gitignore</code> as already
    loaded from a CDN.</p>
